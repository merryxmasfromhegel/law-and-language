title: 'About the project'
---

Our project brings together scholars from Law, Political Science, Philosophy and French Studies at the University of Western Ontario to investigate how laws are interpreted within legal institutions and understood by the public.

Like all language, the language of law can be ambiguous, vague, or otherwise hard to understand. It often combines technical and ordinary meanings, aiming to be precise, but also accessible to everyone. As a result, the intention of the legislature can be unclear. This poses problems both for judges interpreting the law and for people trying to follow it.

Our project aims to study this phenomenon from the perspectives of multiple disciplines, using both philosophical and empirical approaches. The broader goal is to connect scholars globally to explore topics at the intersection of law and language. 

# Ways to take part
**Attend our events.** We are organizing a series of talks in the 2024-2025 academic year. While we're based at the University of Western Ontario, all of our events are either hybrid or online. They are posted on this website and we encourage you to sign up.

**Read or submit a blog post.** We aim to profile relevant scholars and provide updates on pertinent scholarship, academic events, legislation or case law on our blog. Feel free to submit a proposal for a post.
