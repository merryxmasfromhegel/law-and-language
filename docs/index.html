<li><strong>From Forensic Linguistics to AI: the Consequences of Different Understandings of ‘Ground Truth&rsquo; for the Courts</strong> (<a href="https://westernuniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUpduqhqjIsGNcvlB6QlIuR_OB0cqzv5LTG">Zoom registration</a>)</li>
<li>November 12, 12:30 &ndash; 1:50 pm, Faculty of Law, Western University</li>
<li>Abstract: ‘Ground truth’ refers to a fundamental truth, or, for data, to “the real or underlying facts; information that has been checked or facts that have been collected at source” (OED). I present the evolution of this concept and its more specific definition in several domains, comparing, in particular, the requirements of a forensic linguist (or other forensic scientist) as compared to someone working in (so-called) artificial intelligence. I will draw from my own collaborative work in computational linguistics as well as other studies to illustrate some of the pitfalls of the diverging uses of this term when viewed from an evidentiary lens. After discussing challenges that are likely to become more frequent in our judge-as-gatekeeper legal systems, I conclude with a soft-law proposal for expert witness reports to include data statements.</li>

    <p>Fiction, meaning and interpretation I said earlier that legal fictions allow us to modify the reach of the law in particular cases or kinds of case without reinterpreting legal terms. This is one valuable feature of legal fictions brought out by my account. In this section, I’ll elaborate on this point by contrasting legal fictions with an alternative.
The basic problem addressed by legal fictions is this. There is a legal rule that attaches consequences to falling under a certain word, like ‘clergyman’ or ‘dependant.’ In some kinds of case, there are reasons why the consequences should apply even though the word’s requirements are not satisfied, or the consequences should not apply even though the word’s requirements are satisfied. Legal fictions allow us to arrive at the right result without revising the legal rule. Of course, wherever there is a reason to use a legal fiction, there is also a reason to revise the legal rule. So, the technique of legal fictions is particularly useful where there are constraints on our ability to revise the legal rule.

    <p>Perpetual injunction to restrain proceedings against a Dane, for tlie seizure of property of English subjects in Iceland, the seizure being sanctionsd by the Danish, authorities.
The case of Peter Blad, a subject of Denmark, against Bamfield and Others, came now to be heard (of which see the beginning before at the council board (see the preceding case), and the scope of the suit was to stay several actions commenced at law in trespass and trover, for seizing certain goods of the Defendants for trading in Iceland, contrary to certain privileges claimed there by the Plaintiff and others. The Defendants insisted that tins was no cause of state, and was ergo dismissed from the council table; that the injuries they had suffered were great, and such as were done with gome kind of affront to and contempt of the English nation ; that they had a most undoubted right of trade in Iceland, and by the articles of peace with Denmark, were to use their commerce with the subjects of Denmark without molestation ; that if the King of Denmark had granted any patents of privilege contrary to the freedom of trade, they were illegal, and a breach of the treaty in question ; and if the patents were of ancienter date, they had been dispensed with by the contrary practice, which had suffered English to trade there, and so invited the Defendants ; that, however, the Plaintiff had already had all the benefit of this Court which he could reasonably expect, for he obtained an injunction till he had examined his witnesses, and now having perfected his proofs, whatever could avail him here, would also avail him at law ; wherefore they prayed leave, that now, at last, they might go to their trial at law.
